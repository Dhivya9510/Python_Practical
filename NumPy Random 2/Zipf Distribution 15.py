# Zipf Distribution:
  # Zipf distritutions are used to sample data based on zipf's law.
  # Zipf's Law: In a collection, the nth common term is 1/n times of the most common term. E.g. the 5th most common word in English occurs nearly 1/5 times as often as the most common word.
  # It has two parameters:
    # a - distribution parameter.
    # size - The shape of the returned array.

#  Example:
    # Draw out a sample for zipf distribution with distribution parameter 2 with size 2x3:

from numpy import random
p = random.zipf(a=2, size=(2,3))
print(p)

# Visualization of Zipf Distribution
   # Sample 1000 points but plotting only ones with value < 10 for more meaningful chart.
   # Example:

from numpy import random
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

s = random.zipf(a=2,size=1000)
sns.distplot(s[s<10], kde = False)
plt.show()
