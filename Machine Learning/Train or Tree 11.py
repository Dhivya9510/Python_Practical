# Machine Learning - Train/Test
     # Evaluate Your Model
          # In Machine Learning we create models to predict the outcome of certain events, like in the previous chapter where we predicted the CO2 emission of a car when we knew the weight and engine size.
          # To measure if the model is good enough, we can use a method called Train/Test.

# What is Train/Test
       # Train/Test is a method to measure the accuracy of your model.
       # It is called Train/Test because you split the data set into two sets: a training set and a testing set.
       # 80% for training, and 20% for testing.

            # You train the model using the training set.
            # You test the model using the testing set.

# Train the model means create the model.

# Test the model means test the accuracy of the model.

# Start With a Data Set
# Start with a data set you want to test.

# Our data set illustrates 100 customers in a shop, and their shopping habits.

# Example

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
np.random.seed(2)

x = np.random.normal(3,1,100)
y = np.random.normal(150,40,100) / x

plt.scatter(x,y)
plt.show()

# Result:
   # The x axis represents the number of minutes before making a purchase.
   # The y axis represents the amount of money spent on the purchase.

# Split Into Train/Test
    # The training set should be a random selection of 80% of the original data.
    # The testing set should be the remaining 20%.

train_x = x[:80]
train_y = y[:80]

test_x = x[80:]
test_y = y[80:]

# Display the Training Set
   # Display the same scatter plot with the training set:
   # Example

plt.scatter(train_x,train_y)           # because this is the scatter plot for TRAINING SET as described in the question. 
plt.show()

# Result: It looks like the original data set, so it seems to be a fair selection:

# Display the Testing Set
   # To make sure the testing set is not completely different, we will take a look at the testing set as well.
   # Example

plt.scatter(test_x,test_y)
plt.show()

# Result: The testing set also looks like the original data set:

# Fit the Data Set
    # What does the data set look like? In my opinion I think the best fit would be a polynomial regression, so let us draw a line of polynomial regression.
    # To draw a line through the data points, we use the plot() method of the matplotlib module:
    # Example
        # Draw a polynomial regression line through the data points:

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
np.random.seed(2)

x = np.random.normal(3,1,100)
y = np.random.normal(150,40,100) / x

train_x = x[:80]
train_y = y[:80]

test_x = x[80:]
test_y = y[80:]

mymodel = np.poly1d(np.polyfit(train_x,train_y,4))

myline = np.linspace(0,6,100)

plt.scatter(train_x,train_y)
plt.plot(myline,mymodel(myline))
plt.show()

# The result can back my suggestion of the data set fitting a polynomial regression, even though it would give us some weird results if we try to predict values outside of the data set. Example: the line indicates that a customer spending 6 minutes in the shop would make a purchase worth 200. That is probably a sign of overfitting.

# But what about the R-squared score? The R-squared score is a good indicator of how well my data set is fitting the model.

# R2
   # Remember R2, also known as R-squared?
   # It measures the relationship between the x axis and the y axis, and the value ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 means no relationship, and 1 means totally related.
   # The sklearn module has a method called r2_score() that will help us find this relationship.
   # In this case we would like to measure the relationship between the minutes a customer stays in the shop and how much money they spend.
   # Example
        # How well does my training data fit in a polynomial regression?

import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import r2_score
np.random.seed(2)

x = np.random.normal(3,1,100)
y = np.random.normal(150,40,100) / x

train_x = x[:80]
train_y = y[:80]

test_x = x[80:]
test_y = y[80:]

mymodel = np.poly1d(np.polyfit(train_x,train_y,4))

r2 = r2_score(train_y,mymodel(train_x))

print(r2)

# Note: The result 0.799 shows that there is a OK relationship.

# Bring in the Testing Set
   # Now we have made a model that is OK, at least when it comes to training data.
   # Now we want to test the model with the testing data as well, to see if gives us the same result.

# Example
   # Let us find the R2 score when using testing data (the above one is for Training data)

import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import r2_score
np.random.seed(2)

x = np.random.normal(3,1,100)
y = np.random.normal(150,40,100)/ x

train_x = x[:80]
train_y = y[:80]

test_x = x[80:]
test_y = y[80:]

mymodel = np.poly1d(np.polyfit(train_x,train_y,4))

r2 = r2_score(test_y,mymodel(test_x))

print(r2)

# Note: The result 0.809 shows that the model fits the testing set as well, and we are confident that we can use the model to predict future values.

# Predict Values
   # Now that we have established that our model is OK, we can start predicting new values.
   # Example
       # How much money will a buying customer spend, if she or he stays in the shop for 5 minutes?

print(mymodel(5))

# The example predicted the customer to spend 22.88 dollars.


# Own notes: Note that both train and test showing 80 here. Train is 80 but not test is 20, test is also 80 here. 
           # Go through the training & testing set line items. 
           # When we asked to DRAW A POLYNOMIAL REGRESSION, we need to use MATPLOTLIB.PYPLOT AS PLT and we need to include the line item that has LINSPACE. 
           # When we asked to TEST THE FITTING LEVEL OF TRAINING DATA IN POLYNOMIAL REGRESSION, we need to use SKLEARN.METRICS R2_SCORE to include the line item r2_score.  
           # Note the r2 line item input (line number: 121)
