# PYTHON MATH:
   # Python has a set of built-in math functions, including an extensive math module, that allows you to perform mathematical tasks on numbers.
  
# Built-in Math Functions:
 # The min() and max() functions can be used to find the lowest or highest value in an iterable: 

import math

t = min(5,10,15)
p = max(5,10,15)

print(t)
print(p)

# The abs() function returns the absolute (positive) value of the specified number:

# Example:

r = abs(-70.8)

print(r)

# The pow(x, y) function returns the value of x to the power of y (xy).
 # Example:
   # Return the value of 4 to the power of 3 (same as 4 * 4 * 4):

import math

e  = pow(2,3)
print(e)


# The Math Module:
  # Python has also a built-in module called math, which extends the list of mathematical functions.
  # To use it, you must import the math module:

  # When you have imported the math module, you can start using methods and constants of the module.
  # The math.sqrt() method for example, returns the square root of a number:

import math
q = math.sqrt(64)
print(q)

# The math.ceil() method rounds a number upwards to its nearest integer, and the math.floor() method rounds a number downwards to its nearest integer, and returns the result:

# Example:

w = math.ceil(1.3)
e = math.floor(1.3)

print(w)
print(e)

# The math.pi constant, returns the value of PI (3.14...):

import math

g = math.pi

print(g)
